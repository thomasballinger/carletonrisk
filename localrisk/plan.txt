risk game by tom ballinger



2/16/2010
Took a break for a bit, did some real work.  Today started
a game with four people using the graphical interface on the
Eastern Hemisphere map (map4.txt).  Everyone was polluting
the filesystem with 'temp.gif' files until I fixed guiProg.py
so they didn't appear.
Immediate goals: add fog of war, more rule customizations 
from the map file.  Add isContiguous to the board object.


todo as of late 2/2/2010
Text-based interface exists, available for alex and tom
to test.
The new plan is to eventually use FSLview for viewing the
3d map of the brain.  Modifying .nii files probably, but 
modifying nrrd format is definetly possible.  Load various
labelmaps in fsl so transparency can be controlled for each.
Is the 3D view in FSL fast enough for this?  Shades of primary
colors can indicate how many troops, so that when moused over
it is clear who ownes and how many are there.  Command line
interface still possible, or a tcl window with buttons and 
sliders for various actions.  "Attack [] from [] with []" sort
of thing.  Have to update the pulldown menus with map info.
Button for update view.  Hopefully CLI exists for FSLview 3D?
On labelmap map have clear, wide connectors between regions.

started 2/1/2010

Want a game which is represented in pickled python structured, and
command line tools for:
-viewing the map
-taking a turn
 -things like 'attack USA from canada with 3'
 -but also 'attack USA' and prompt (from canada with 3)?
- if try 'place', 'attack', or 'move' at the wrong time, denied - but
   that's a layer out
-display always allowed
