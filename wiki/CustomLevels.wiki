#summary Instructions for creating custom levels

= Introduction =

Super-customizable!  Until a decent web interface exists however, you'll have to email your maps to the project leads who will integrate them.  What we need from you is:
 * Map file in some form
 * Level file, as described in following section

= Level File Spec =
The format used is a plain-text and human readable.  Unlayerable tags like <start-settings> and <end-settings> designate data sections, and everything outside of those tagged sections is a comment.  The required sections are:
 * settings
 * nodeNetwork
  * each line begins with a country name, then lists of countries accessible from that country
 * mapFile
  * unique image identifier name (just use your image filename)
 * cordinates
  * each line begins with a country, then lists the x and y cordinates of the location of that country on the map image, x from the left and y from the top of the image
 * bonuses
  * each line begins with a list of countries, then has the number of extra units awarded per turn for holding every country in that list

Long list sections have been shortened a lot
